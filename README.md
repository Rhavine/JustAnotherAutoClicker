# JustAnotherAutoClicker
A client-side Minecraft mod that auto clicks. Available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-another-auto-clicker).

## Note
This mod is aimed to reduce the amount of manual grind (e.g. clicking on sieves) in modded Minecraft (preferably single player). Being a macro, it has cheating potential. Don't use it to cheat on servers or Larry the Alpaca will hunt you down at night (he's outside your house right now :)).
